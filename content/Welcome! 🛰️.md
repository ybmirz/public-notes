Hello there ðŸ‘‹ <br>
Seems like in one way or another, I got your attention to stumble upon this repository of information. Thanks for stopping by! Hope I manage to drop some bits of information that you'd find useful, or at the least thought-provoking. 

Hit me up, always down for a chat - hit me up on [discord](https://discordapp.com/users/574558925224017920) `xenonial` or be a romantic and [mail me](mailto:me@mirzahiday.at). I enjoy thoughtful and intellectual discussions, and all parties playing self-devil's advocate.
### What is this?

This is my lovely digital garden. A person of importance in my life once shared with me on the worries of a digital footprint, anything that gets put out there can easily be made incriminating, for or against you. 
But I wanted an outlet for a creative medium - found that this may be the best way to do it. I write and type to express, to potentially connect (it'd be amazing if we connect this way!). This space serves as my public notebook where I document my journey and learning (in public) through achieving my delusions of consumer quantum computation, software development, system analysis and the occasional surprising intersections between technology and literature.

>Think of this space as my public research lab, where ideas quantum entangle with each other to form new insights. (yes "am i quirky doe, am i edgy doe")

Here you'll find my thoughts on:

- Quantum computing research and implementations
- My ramblings as I read eastern european and levant literature, and the occasional philosophical gambles.
- Various technical experiments and project documentation, from this website to literally anything.
- Random musings about life, tech, and everything in between

### More about me 
**In 10 Seconds**:
- a passionate researcher and software developer, actively researching in quantum computation (the goal is to exploit fundamental physics for our uses!) with a day job in software development.
- i love the concept of third places, human behaviour and learning.
	- i find human behaviour so fascinating, it's as unpredictable as quantum mechanics! 
- For the MBTI pseudo-scientists: INTJ
- avid gamer (from competitive fps to JRPGs, currently getting into strategy)
- [Anime watcher](https://anilist.co/user/xenonial/) (i love delusional stories)
- dostoyevsky, kafka, and sherlock [enjoyer](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24046711-miru)
- i am both sherlock-ed and a benedict cumberbitch (*"penglins"*)
